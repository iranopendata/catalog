# IOD Dataset Spec

This spec is adapted from [Data Packages](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) in TOML with some modifications. This is a draft specification. If you have comments, suggestions or modifications visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/iranopendata/catalog/issues) or submit a pull request.
